# Redux Feedback Loop

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

This project allows Prime students to take a feedback survey for Prime Digital Academy. 
On each page, the student is able to answer the survery question by entering their rating (1-5)
in the input field or enter text for comments, then click the 'Next' button to proceed to the 
next page. Once all survery questions have been answered, the student will be brought to a review
page to see their responses and then submit their response. The database will capture the students'
response once they click submit.
